Implementation errors:
I was receiving a 404 error after adding the index.html file to redirect my cs.tufts.edu webpage to my github webpage. I had changed all the permissions in the required directories and files; the error came from a backslash at the end of the URL: "www.cs.tufts.edu/~bdawso04/" returned 404, but without the final "/" the page redirected correctly.
